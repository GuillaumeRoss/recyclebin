The Verge now has a [subscription](https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/3/24306571/verge-subscription-launch-fewer-ads-unlimited-access-full-text-rss) offering. 

RSS feeds? Great. Fewer ads and trackers? Sounds promising. But how much less annoying is it actually?

To find out, I disabled my fortress of ad and tracker blocking (clean browser profile, no extensions, no Little Snitch, VPN-ed into a naked network). Then, I tested a [car](https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/29/24308950/hyundai-ioniq-5-n-review-price-specs-photos) review across three setups, scrolling the page in 15 seconds each time.

Here are the very manual, not-at-all scientific results:


| Configuration        | Requests | MB Transferred | MB Resources |
| -------------------- | -------- | -------------- | ------------ |
| No Ad Block or Sub   | 805      | 8.3            | 43.2         |
| No Ad Block with Sub | 611      | 2.6            | 27.2         |
| Ad Block with Sub    | 128      | 0.8            | 7.65         |

## TL;DR

Even with a subscription, The Verge still drowns you in ads and trackers—just slightly fewer. Their privacy policy mentions **865** data partners (**533** claiming “strictly necessary” cookies).

For that reason, I'd recommend not allow listing them in your ad blocker even if you are a paid customer, but it might make you feel better knowing they get revenue even though you're blocking the ads?
