The issue is how Apple deals with smart cards. FIDO/PIV/PGP use the CCID interface that uses the smart card service. Apple architecture causes the smart card service to be put to sleep and once a heartbeat goes to the usb device to check, it will then have to reactivate, for smart cards such as PIV and PGP this happens more often than FIDO standard. This however, is all in MacOS software and not related to the YubiKey. There is not a way for us to change our firmware and still function within the standard. Apple has this information but has not provided us with a timeline nor any change or expected solution.</p></blockquote><p>This issue would therefore also occur with other types of smartcard readers on macOS, but they&rsquo;re rare, especially in form factors someone would leave connected to a laptop.</p><h3 id=bug-report-to-apple>Bug report to Apple<a href=#bug-report-to-apple class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>#</a></h3><p>I&rsquo;ve submitted a <em>Feedback</em> to Apple, <code>FB16482480</code>.
