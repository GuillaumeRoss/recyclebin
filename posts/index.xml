&lt;p>&lt;em>TL;DR Version: Make sure your iOS devices can connect to the HomeKit Devices on port 80 and 443, and replicate mDNS from VLAN/Subnet to VLAN/Subnet with Avahi.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, you’ve setup multiple VLANs and SSIDs at home, you’re keeping all those Internet Connected toasters away from the LAN where your crown jewels sit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Good! Except, woops, a ton of stuff is broken?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>HomeKit uses the &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/homekit-accessory-protocol/">HAP Protocol&lt;/a>, which actually uses peer-to-peer connectivity for really fast action when you try to perform actions. If your device is unable to reach the HomeKit device, it will, through iCloud, try to perform the HomeKit action through your AppleTV.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If your AppleTV is unable to reach the HomeKit device, the request will fail.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If your AppleTV is in the right subnet and DOES reach it, it will work, however, it will be slower than if it had worked directly from your device. And believe me, 500ms of lag when trying to turn on the lights can be a significant pain.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here is how to get it working almost as if it was on the same network.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Note&lt;/strong>: This is not the most restrictive configuration possible. I am sure you can lock it down more, especially if everything you have has known hostnames or assigned IPs that do not change.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Allow your main LAN to connect to port 80 and 443 on HomeKit devices. You can do this via IP to IP + port rules, or, if you do not mind your main network reaching the IoT network, simply allow 80 and 443 from Main to IoT LANs. You can make this more restrictive by only allowing the static or reserved IPs of devices you use with HomeKit. Be sure to include your AppleTV or iPad so your schedules work when you’re away.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Disable Guest Isolation on your IoT SSID while you pair the devices (the pairing process seems to require p2p connectivity for some devices, and in any case, some apps will force you to send Wi-Fi settings from your phone, preventing you from being on the main SSID while you do this).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Join your IoT SSID with your phone.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Add the device to HomeKit. I tested this with iDevices devices (Ferrari LaFerrari anyone?). Their process for adding devices is very brittle, and I had a lot of issues, and had to try again many times. I had to do that the first time I set them up on a single Wi-Fi and VLAN however.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Install &lt;a href="https://avahi.org/">Avahi&lt;/a> on your Firewall, or on any device that sees both the Main and the IoT VLAN. It can be made to work on many devices, but of course if you are using pfSense it is available as a &lt;a href="https://doc.pfsense.org/index.php/Avahi_package">package&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Enable Avahi, and make sure it is listening on your IoT and your Main interface (deny it everywhere else). This is where you could potentially lock this down more: create custom rules and settings so it only works from specific IoT devices. In my case, it wasn’t worth it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Reconnect your phone to your main SSID.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Turn the lights on and off and on and off and on and off. And on and off and on and off. &lt;strong>It works!&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Re-enable guest isolation on your IoT SSID&lt;/strong>. Do not forget this step, you don’t want your toaster to hack your fridge do you? &lt;em>Note: Some APs are very hardcore with their guest isolation, and will block traffic from/to any RFC1918 address. If enabling guest isolation breaks your previously working setup, look to see if you can create custom ACLs on your AP. If not, I would recommend creating an SSID only for HomeKit devices, and leaving guest isolation disabled. In some cases, you will need to whitelist your Main LAN from it completely, but this should be filtered by your firewall anyway. On some, such as Ubiquiti UniFi gear, you need to allow the guest isolated SSID to talk to 224.0.0.251 for mDNS.&lt;/em>&lt;/li>

&lt;p>The Fleet handbook contains detailed information on how we have configured Google Workspace &lt;a href="https://fleetdm.com/handbook/security#email-security">to block spam and phishing&lt;/a>. Gmail has some exciting email security features, such as flagging or blocking mail from people with the same name as employees or quarantining it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These features are great for protecting from business email compromise (BEC) and other types of social engineering attacks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With this configuration, many of the less targeted, basic attempts at BEC get filtered, which is why an attempt we received a few weeks ago caught our attention.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Google Groups mailing lists have much weaker protection, and the Gmail security settings could create a false sense of security.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="attack-goal">Attack goal&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The attacker(s) seemed interested in obtaining copies of unpaid invoices from Fleet to our customers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As this seems to have been attempted by a BEC group, we think they likely wanted to obtain unpaid invoices so they could trick our customers into paying an actual invoice into the wrong bank account.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Even people well trained against these types of scams could fall to it, especially if the actual invoice they receive is the one they expected all along!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To obtain these invoices, the attacker impersonated a salesperson. Salespeople requesting copies of invoices could make sense, as they are often paid commissions or bonuses on sales and might get in touch with clients to make sure invoices are well received.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how-it-got-through">How it got through&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>As we have employee impersonation protection enabled, we were surprised that such a simple malicious email made it through the Gmail filters.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The attacker sent the message to a &lt;em>group/mailing list&lt;/em>, not an individual. The email had a valid DKIM signature, as a real email account was used, with only the name spoofed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once Google Groups processes the email, it forwards it to internal and external recipients. Since Groups is the one sending the message, with a &lt;em>from&lt;/em> that is now in the domain used for Google Workspace, the DKIM signature is valid. Internal recipients receive it without additional filtering, as it is a trusted internal email. External recipients receive it with a very high chance of delivery as the message is authenticated correctly and comes from a domain they interact with regularly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>From a UI point of view, the recipient can easily mistake the message for a legitimate one, as the domain name is either replaced with the legitimate domain or gets the mention &amp;ldquo;via legitimatedomain.com&amp;rdquo; added.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our mistake was assuming the message went through the same filters used for regular email. In reality, Google Groups uses different technologies for filtering spam, and the more advanced Gmail features do not apply.&lt;/p>

&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>We contacted Google to ask why this message made it through filters. They confirmed that the filters are different on Groups vs Gmail (emphasis ours) in a response to our issue:&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>We then asked if any of the advanced spam filter rules from Gmail worked in Google Groups:&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>In this case, the attacker didn&amp;rsquo;t spoof our domain, so enabling this feature did not help.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Two weeks after this happened, we saw a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Centurion/status/1549780307544379392?s=20&amp;amp;t=aehcFzyPfH_56fCLGpRddA">Tweet&lt;/a> by Chris Long at Material security, who had written a &lt;a href="https://material.security/blog/identify-google-groups-vulnerable-to-spam-and-spoofing">blog post&lt;/a> on this topic.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Chris and Material tested and realized that Google Groups delivered five out of six types of spoofed emails while Gmail blocked all six. They also figured out why the original email was replaced with the mailing list email, as Google Groups replaced it when the DMARC policy caused the delivery to fail.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We performed the same tests at Fleet, using &lt;a href="https://emailspooftest.com/">emailspooftest&lt;/a>. Our results were slightly different, but we successfully sent two very suspicious email messages to a mailing list. When we sent the same type of email to an individual, Gmail blocked each attempt.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how-we-noticed-and-stopped-the-attack">How we noticed and stopped the attack&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>At Fleet, we have excellent employees and contractors with amazing eyes for detail. We share information about potential scams, including phishing messages, over Slack, so the entire company is always aware of the suspicious stuff we see.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The person who received the email found it, if not necessarily suspicious, at least out of the ordinary. They contacted someone else to ask if that type of request was normal. This second person confirmed that it was not a genuine request and that, in any case, unpaid invoices should never be shared like this, even if the request came from an actual employee.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We communicate internally almost exclusively using Slack. Unlike email, impersonating someone on Slack would require compromising accounts configured with Two-Factor Authentication, making it a much more appropriate channel to discuss anything sensitive.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="recommendations">Recommendations&lt;/h2>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Warn and train all employees to be even more careful with mail sent to a mailing list, specifically that if an email is sent &amp;ldquo;via&amp;rdquo; your domain, it has a high probability of being spoofed.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Use a tool like &lt;a href="https://emailspooftest.com/">emailspooftest&lt;/a> as recommended by Material Security to test your filters. Try a regular user, then a group. Adjust your assumptions.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Limit the number of Google Groups that can receive external emails.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Limit the number of internal users that can send emails &amp;ldquo;on behalf&amp;rdquo; of a group, to prevent legitimate emails from being sent &amp;ldquo;via&amp;rdquo; the group and makeing people accustomed to seeing them.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Avoid using common/obvious names for mailing lists.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Apply Material Security&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://material.security/blog/identify-google-groups-vulnerable-to-spam-and-spoofing">recommendation&lt;/a> to flag unauthenticated emails to groups.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Train your accounting teams to never respond to such requests via email but to contact individuals through a safer way, such as Slack.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Train your accounting teams to share files using services such as Google Drive, with explicit sharing to other employees within the domain. That way, even if someone agrees to give our fake salesperson access to invoices, the person who will get access is the actual employee.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Special request&lt;/strong>: If you use Google Workspace with Groups for mailing lists, please perform the &lt;a href="https://emailspooftest.com/">emailspooftest&lt;/a> tests and open a support case with Google asking them to get Groups protection on par with Gmail. Without that happening, all the security we apply to individual accounts is moot unless you somehow have an entire company that does not need any mailing lists!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With the BEC cases explosion, we hope Google introduces more advanced spam filtering to Google Groups. We should not have to consider running email through a generic standard Gmail account and forwarding it from there instead of using Google Groups!&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>Securing bank accounts from business email compromise</title><link>https://recyclebin.zip/posts/2023-05-12-bank-security/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://recyclebin.zip/posts/2023-05-12-bank-security/</guid><description>This article was originally published on the Fleet blog.

Securing bank accounts from business email compromise According to the FBI, business email compromise (BEC) attacks are increasing in popularity yearly, costing organizations over 43 billion dollars in losses between 2016 and 2021.
As BEC is a form of social engineering, we often think education is the only way to reduce the odds of getting compromised.</description><content>&lt;p>This article was originally published on the &lt;a href="https://fleetdm.com/blog/securing-bank-accounts-from-business-email-compromise/">Fleet blog&lt;/a>. Minor style changes were applied.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="securing-bank-accounts-from-business-email-compromise">Securing bank accounts from business email compromise&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>According to the &lt;a href="https://www.ic3.gov/Media/Y2022/PSA220504">FBI&lt;/a>, business email compromise (BEC) attacks are increasing in popularity yearly, costing organizations over 43 billion dollars in losses between 2016 and 2021.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As BEC is a form of social engineering, we often think education is the only way to reduce the odds of getting compromised.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Security teams often focus on protecting IT assets only, but what could be more damaging to your company than having its bank account emptied fraudulently?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since BEC typically targets one straightforward thing, money, there are controls we can implement to reduce the risk significantly. The parameters suggested in this post are those we found the most useful through our research. Unlike previous posts in this series, we cannot be as specific about how to enable them as every bank is different.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="email-configuration">Email configuration&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>While good email hygiene can&amp;rsquo;t stop BEC, it can at least reduce the number of fraudulent emails that make it through and force criminals to work harder.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Require secure two-factor authentication (2FA) to access email, such as &lt;a href="https://fidoalliance.org/specs/u2f-specs-master/fido-u2f-overview.html">FIDO U2F&lt;/a> security keys. Using U2F keys makes the credentials phishing-resistant, lowering the risk of malicious access to your email accounts from being used to launch an internal BEC attempt.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Configure email security features such as &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/2466580?product_name=UnuFlow&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;visit_id=637919491839685136-2075570827&amp;amp;rd=1&amp;amp;src=supportwidget0&amp;amp;hl=en">SPF, DMARC, and DKIM&lt;/a>. These help make it harder to impersonate your domain name in an email.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Configure spam filters to protect your organization from people impersonating employees from other domain names. On Google Workspace/Gmail, this setting is called &lt;strong>Protect against spoofing of employee names&lt;/strong>, and you should enable it along with &lt;strong>Protect against inbound emails spoofing your domain&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>You can find detailed instructions on configuring Google Workspace in the &lt;a href="https://fleetdm.com/handbook/security#email-authentication">Fleet handbook&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="online-banking-configuration">Online banking configuration&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The best email configuration ever is not enough to protect from BEC and other types of social engineering attacks. Something will always slip by, and we must assume that even well-trained employees will fall for a good enough attempt.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you think you can&amp;rsquo;t fall victim to these emails, you probably have not received one that was sufficiently well-targeted and delivered at precisely the right time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As defenders, we often say that while we must always be perfect, attackers only need to succeed once. As &lt;a href="https://www.dragos.com/blog/industry-news/the-myth-of-the-adversary-advantage/">Joe Slowik&lt;/a> explained in this excellent blog post a couple of years ago, that is seldom true. We defenders have the high ground, but we often fail to leverage it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since we know the attackers are looking for money, instead of trying to train people to be perfect at spotting scams, which is impossible, let&amp;rsquo;s secure the cash!&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="authentication">Authentication&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>If someone can break into your bank accounts directly, they won&amp;rsquo;t need to come up with a convincing email or text message to convince you to move money. It is therefore critical to enable the most advanced security features your bank offers. Unfortunately, in North America, many banks fail to offer any 2FA or only offer SMS-based 2FA, which is the weakest form of 2FA but is still better than nothing.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="0">
&lt;li>Keep the number of people with online banking access as low as possible.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If available, enable 2FA. FIDO U2F, although very rare right now with banks, is preferable. Otherwise, use app-based 2FA. As a last resort, use SMS 2FA.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If a setting exists to make 2FA prompt either &lt;em>always&lt;/em> or &lt;em>when the risk level is high&lt;/em>, set it to &lt;em>always&lt;/em>. Weaker options leave the doors wide open for someone to bypass 2FA.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Some banks allow organizational-level controls, but most do not. You might have to talk to everyone with access to your online banking and check their 2FA configuration, but if you don&amp;rsquo;t have more than a handful, it&amp;rsquo;s worth doing.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="dual-control-for-configuration">Dual control for configuration&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Many settings we recommend configuring require high privilege access to online banking. We have to assume that a well-informed attacker would be able to trick someone into changing those.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By enabling dual control, one administrator can make a change, but it will not be active until a second one approves it. This makes it much harder for social engineering attacks to succeed and protects these settings if a single account is compromised.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="alerting">Alerting&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Alerts are often triggered when something bad has already happened, but sometimes, there might still be time to fix things before they worsen.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Depending on your bank, you might have various alerts you can configure. For example, &lt;a href="https://www.svb.com/private-bank/help/resources/digital-banking/managing-digital-banking-alerts">SVB&lt;/a> &lt;del>has&lt;/del> had security alerts as well as transaction alerts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If possible, enable at least the following:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Alert when a new recipient is added&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Alert when a wire transfer is created (domestic or international)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Alert when an external transfer is created&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Alert when an address or other contact information is changed&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Alert on any transaction above a certain threshold, such as $10,000&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Banks typically deliver these alerts via email, which is not ideal for rapid awareness. To improve that, create an email address never used anywhere else specifically for these alerts. You&amp;rsquo;ll then be able to integrate that mailbox to other tools, like Slack, by using a &lt;a href="https://slack.com/help/articles/206819278-Send-emails-to-Slack#:~:text=To%20send%20an%20email%20to,see%20your%20email%20in%20Slack.">forwarding address&lt;/a>.
With this configuration, you can deliver these alerts in your administrative or accounting channel, where everyone can see them, create a thread and ask questions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On top of email alerts, inform your accounting department that they should pay attention to push notifications from your online banking application. If you can keep the amount of &amp;ldquo;false positives&amp;rdquo; down and your accounting and finance are all in the same time zone, have a rotation for who will let the app notify them even when in do not disturb mode.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="dual-and-triple-approval">Dual and triple approval&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Most business banks allow customers to set thresholds above which the system will require multiple approvals.
A threshold of $10,000 before a second approval is needed makes sure that if an attacker compromised a single person, they could only send away money in $10,000 batches. Alerting remains essential as the total cost can grow pretty quickly, but it is much safer than allowing a single person to move millions of dollars.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Consider requiring three approvals for substantial transactions, as long as your team is large enough to accommodate this even when people are on vacation or unavailable for any other reason.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="ach-filters">ACH filters&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>ACH stands for Automated Clearing House, a network used for direct payments, especially in the US. If your company is in the US and deals with US vendors, you probably send most of your payments with ACH.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Many banks offer ACH filters on business accounts. These filters work like many security controls, using one of two main methods:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>In deny list mode, where you provide criteria to deny payments&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In allow list mode, where you give criteria to allow payments&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Allow listing is safer but requires more work to implement. Some banks allow combinations of vendors and amounts, while others only allow lists of vendors.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Before implementing ACH filters, obtain a list of all ACH transfers made in the last 18 months. Identify the vendors you have that are still active, the average amount you pay them, plus a buffer to cover increases, and then provide this list to your bank to enable ACH filtering in allow list mode. Have every other payment generate an &lt;strong>exception&lt;/strong> that will require manual intervention.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That way, it will be much harder for a single person to send a large amount of money to an unauthorized vendor, and accidentally sending large transfers to legit vendors will be blocked.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="training">Training&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>To protect against BEC, we will always need to train people. No matter what technical controls are in place, by using urgency and well-crafted pretexts, criminals will always find a way to trick people into acting against the company&amp;rsquo;s best interests.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you require advanced training before implementing these basic controls, you fail your employees by not providing a system and processes with essential protection. Security teams and organizations must design and configure systems where they are reasonably safe before putting the burden of security on the end-users. Of course, security is everyone&amp;rsquo;s responsibility, but how would you feel if your security team reminded you not to type your password on phishing websites before they had implemented 2FA for remote access?&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="checklist">Checklist&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Access to email requires 2FA&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Phishing and spam filters are configured with strict settings to prevent user and domain spoofing&lt;/li>

&lt;p>If many people in your family are on the Apple ecosystem, here are a few things worth checking while you’re going to be in the same physical location over the holidays.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ensure they have enough iCloud data and recent backups, then, enable automatic updates, and nudge them into updating (bring a couple chargers!), as these features are recent.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If they don’t have any iCloud storage, consider rolling them into your iCloud “Family” to share paid storage, it’s cheap and sometimes worth it versus trying to convince people to pay for backups 😅.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then, go into iCloud Settings/Security and review the following:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Enable iCloud &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/authentication/">Two-Factor Authentication&lt;/a> (2FA) if they don’t have it. No need to go crazy with FIDO keys unless they’re security nerds or at-risk targets.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Account Recovery: Make sure everyone has at least one “&lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212513">Recovery Contact&lt;/a>” to help them back into their Apple IDs if something happens.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Legacy Contact: Do the same for “&lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/102631">Legacy Contacts&lt;/a>”, which can be used to recover access to someone’s iCloud data after they pass. It’s less awkward to do this while reviewing a bunch of security settings than to bring it up on its own randomly!&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>As a bonus, if you’ve got security enthusiasts around you who have up to date devices on their Apple accounts, it’s a good time to enable &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213465">iMessage Contact Key Verification&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Most people don’t need it, but if they’re interested in security, it’s a nice feature to demo while in physical proximity.&lt;/p></content></item></channel></rss>
