&lt;p>RSS feeds? Great. Fewer ads and trackers? Sounds promising. But how much less annoying is it actually?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To find out, I disabled my fortress of ad and tracker blocking (clean browser profile, no extensions, no Little Snitch, VPN-ed into a naked network). Then, I tested a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/29/24308950/hyundai-ioniq-5-n-review-price-specs-photos">car&lt;/a> review across three setups, scrolling the page in 15 seconds each time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here are the very manual, not-at-all scientific results:&lt;/p>
&lt;table>
&lt;thead>
&lt;tr>
&lt;th>Configuration&lt;/th>
&lt;th>Requests&lt;/th>

&lt;td>7.65&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
&lt;h2 id="tldr">TL;DR&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Even with a subscription, The Verge still drowns you in ads and trackers—just slightly fewer. Their privacy policy mentions &lt;strong>865&lt;/strong> data partners (&lt;strong>533&lt;/strong> claiming “strictly necessary” cookies).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For that reason, I&amp;rsquo;d recommend not allow listing them in your ad blocker even if you are a paid customer, but it might make you feel better knowing they get revenue even though you&amp;rsquo;re blocking the ads?&lt;/p>

As the Apple &lt;em>blogosphere&lt;/em> is dominated by very good independant writers, this is an issue that is rarely discussed, as it impacts people working for larger organizations with dedicated Mac hardware.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It took Apple years to enable family photo sharing in Photos, as if all users managed photos individually. Eventually, they delivered a solid feature for shared family libraries. Before they did, people were sharing photos using third party applications, and in many cases, reducing their own privacy levels by involving more companies in the process.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Similarly, Apple seems to assume we all use a single Mac tied to the same iCloud account as our iPhone, Apple Watch, iPad, and Vision Pro, leading to people performing actions that degrade their own privacy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/ca/pro-display-xdr/specs/">Pro Display XDR&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/ca/studio-display/specs/">Studio Display&lt;/a>, released in 2019 and 2022 respectively, have a single input. &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/105126">Target Display Mode&lt;/a> hasn&amp;rsquo;t been a thing since 2014.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This creates a dilemma for those needing both a personal and work Mac: use non-Apple monitors, dedicate significant desk space to a single-use Apple display, or manually switch cables, since Thunderbolt switching remains uncommon and expensive.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Except for Dell&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://www.dell.com/en-ca/shop/dell-ultrasharp-32-6k-monitor-u3224kb/apd/210-bhbz/monitors-monitor-accessories">weird looking&lt;/a> 6K monitor, there aren&amp;rsquo;t many great high resolution monitors on the market. The gaming monitor market is doing great, but those monitors are quite different from what is ideal to do work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Software could help. &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/102459">Universal Control&lt;/a> could let you work across two separate Macs easily. But on the software side, the situation is the same, Apple still believes you don&amp;rsquo;t have a job.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You might not want &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-ca/102426">Handoff&lt;/a> to propose opening up your personal Safari tabs on your work computer, and your employer might not want you to use &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/102442">Watch Unlock&lt;/a> from your personal watch to their laptop.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Still, camera and screen streaming features such as &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/102546">Continuity Camera&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/102597">SideCar&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/118521">Mac Virtual Display&lt;/a> which could be extremely useful, but instantly become pointless when you realize you have to be on the same iCloud account on both devices.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While privacy and security concerns justified limiting these features to a single iCloud account, both wireless and wired connections are supported, and Apple excels as implementing secure solutions to complex problems.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Why not let me use Sidecar with my personal iPad over USB? The connection could enable screen transfer only, respecting MDM restrictions and preventing actions like data transfer.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Continuity Camera could work similarly, streaming my iPhone’s “webcam” to my work Mac via USB.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Mac Virtual Display on visionOS is, for me, the killer app on visionOS. Even with a developer strap, Vision Pro could justify its presence in my travel bag by serving as a computer with personal apps that can also be used as a massive monitor for hotel work. Because of the current restrictions, the Vision Pro becomes much less useful as I do not have a mouse and keyboard for it with me, but I need to travel with an extra monitor or iPad with a &lt;a href="https://astropad.com/product/lunadisplay/">third party dongle&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Today, only independent developers, bloggers, and consultants with all devices on a single iCloud account can achieve this—unless they compromise privacy by logging into iCloud on a work Mac.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I doubt Apple will make a multi-input monitor, but they could build secure implementations of these features, with MDM controls for organizations to disable them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Please Apple, make our personal devices feel lighter and more useful in our bags when we travel for work, and most of all, &lt;strong>stop creating a situation that undoubtedly pushes people to log in to work Macs with their personal iCloud accounts&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Some seem to love Cyber Security Awareness Month. Of course, at least as many despise it, because it makes no sense to have intense focus for one month and then forget about it for the other 11.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Without saying if I love it or if I hate it, I decided to write a set of rules. If any of this is a problem in your organization, you HAVE to fix it before you are allowed to fill up user’s inboxes with more “awareness”.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Have you recently told someone working in HR to not open attachments in email? Have you told someone to not click things on the &lt;a href="https://x.com/swagitda_/status/1503751776134180873">thing-clicking machine&lt;/a>?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here are signs you shouldn’t hire some “creatives” to generate “content” to “educate users” this year:&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="your-company-blocks-copypaste-on-a-website-login-form">Your company blocks copy/paste on a website login form&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Are you making any person using a password manager to log in to your service hate computers, your company AND behave less securely by blocking paste for “security reasons” ?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Are you driving people to install &lt;a href="https://github.com/jswanner/DontF-WithPaste">browser extensions&lt;/a> just to deal with the completely irrational behavior your login form exhibits?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Why? Do you WANT people to reuse passwords from other sites, making sure their accounts on your service will get compromised, or do you simply want people to use simple passwords that are easier to crack?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Did an auditor tell you to do this, and nobody dared argue?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Go fix this before you tell any of your employees or customers ANYTHING about cyber security awareness month.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="password-expiration">Password expiration&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Because you want your helpdesk to suffer, you make passwords expire. Sure, there is absolutely no security benefit to it because people only rotate the last digit in the password, but in 2006, a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualified_Security_Assessor">QSA&lt;/a> told you to do this every 90 days.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>NIST started recommending that practice to end years ago. This fall, they’ve made that guidance stronger.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If your employees or customers have to rotate passwords at a certain frequency, you are hereby prohibited from celebrating October Cyber Security Awareness Month.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="no-password-manager-for-employees">No password manager for employees&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Are you really going to send an animated video of poor quality to people, instructing them not to reuse passwords, while simultaneously not providing them with an easy to use password manager?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Slow down, Satan!&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="weak-or-no-mfa">Weak or no MFA&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Stop blaming people for leaking credentials when &lt;a href="https://fidoalliance.org/fido2/">technical solutions&lt;/a> exist. Imagine if cars came with a button that made the airbags pop, and car manufacturers repeatedly told you not to press it. Just REMOVE THE FACE PUNCHING BUTTON!&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="your-hr-departments-sends-emails-indistinguishable-from-phishing">Your HR departments sends emails indistinguishable from phishing&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Explaining to someone what is and is not phishing is very difficult. Most people do not know that email can be sent without authentication. Many of you reading this are already thinking of yelling at me in your heads “But but SPF! DKIM/DMARC! Hasn’t this guy heard of BIMI?”. Alright.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But in reality, spam will also come from domains that aren’t the right one. Sure, it’s not exactly the right domain, but it looks like it. Or it’s a completely unrelated domain, with a reply-to that seems to be legit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>How do you explain any of this to someone and then expect them not to be confused when the HR department sends out a survey asking for sensitive information, hosted on a free SurveyMonkey page that isn’t on a subdomain of your company? Or when your support team does the same to a customer, using some support SaaS tool that isn’t on your domain?&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="laptops-that-cant-survive-hotel-wi-fi">Laptops that can’t survive hotel Wi-Fi&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>VPN VPN VPN VPN VPN VPN VPN. Why do so many people sound like a sponsored Youtube video?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you’re recommending that people use a VPN when using “public Wi-Fi” because you’re afraid of data being sniffed or modified in transit, spend some time &lt;a href="https://chromeenterprise.google/policies/#SSLErrorOverrideAllowed">hardening browsers&lt;/a> and laptops, and ensure you do not provide any service over unencrypted protocols like POP3 or IMAP without TLS.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once you’re done with that, when you get the urge to yell “VPN” again at a random person using a laptop at Starbucks, read &lt;a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/~akgul/papers/vpn-ads.pdf">this&lt;/a> to relax instead.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="authenticating-callers-at-the-help-desk-with-security-questions">Authenticating callers at the help desk with security questions&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Security questions are just passwords, but worse. Not only are they not safe, they’re not user friendly. How would I remember what I said my favorite dessert is? And if I said “poutine”, then everyone knows anyway.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Worse, relying on “private” information like SSNs. Social security numbers for pretty much everyone have been leaked at least once, so why are we using this to authenticate anyone?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Instead of having everyone in your company waste an hour looking at videos about not putting passwords on post-it notes, rework your password reset process to use multifactor authentication.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="next-time-to-celebrate">Next? Time to celebrate!&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>If you did get rid of one of these outdated practices, you’re now allowed to celebrate by sharing with your employees and/or customers why you did it, and how they’re now safer AND more productive.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You’ve used October Cyber Security Awareness month as an excuse to improve cyber security.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Well done!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Managing Apple Intelligence via MDM</title><link>https://recyclebin.zip/posts/2024-09-25-apple-intelligence-mdm/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://recyclebin.zip/posts/2024-09-25-apple-intelligence-mdm/</guid><description>&lt;p>This summer, since WWDC, I was repeatedly asked:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>How do I disable Apple Intelligence on our company laptops?&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Apple Intelligence didn&amp;rsquo;t exist yet. Not even in the betas, plus, Apple is pretty strict around betas and NDAs.
The features were clearly going to roll out in stages throughout the year, so my answer was always, “Yeah, you’ll probably be able to control each one via MDM once the new settings drop.”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now, with the release of iOS 18 and macOS 15, we&amp;rsquo;ve got some of those settings to play with.
Apple Intelligence shows up in iOS 18.1 and macOS 15.1, so you can prepare.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As with most settings that make the device less useful, they require a supervised device, so forget doing that on BYOD.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The settings are in &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/devicemanagement/restrictions">restrictions&lt;/a>. By searching for &amp;ldquo;iOS 18 and later&amp;rdquo; on the page, we can find the new settings, most of which are Apple Intelligence related:&lt;/p>
&lt;table>
&lt;thead>
&lt;tr>
&lt;th>Setting&lt;/th>
&lt;th>Description&lt;/th>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/thead>
&lt;tbody>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>allowGenmoji&lt;/td>
&lt;td>If false, prohibits creating new Genmoji. Requires a supervised device. Available in iOS 18 and later.&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>allowImagePlayground&lt;/td>
&lt;td>If false, prohibits the use of image generation. Requires a supervised device. Available in iOS 18 and later and macOS 15 and later.&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>allowImageWand&lt;/td>
&lt;td>If false, prohibits the use of Image Wand. Requires a supervised device. Available in iOS 18 and later.&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>allowPersonalizedHandwritingResults&lt;/td>
&lt;td>If false, prevents the system from generating text in the user’s handwriting. Requires a supervised device. Available in iOS 18 and later.&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>allowWritingTools&lt;/td>
&lt;td>If false, disables Apple Intelligence writing tools. Requires a supervised device. Available in iOS 18 and later and macOS 15 and later.&lt;/td>
&lt;/tr>
&lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>
&lt;p>Most people asking me how to disable Apple Intelligence this summer were specifically worried about ChatGPT/OpenAI integration, which has not been released yet.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Based on those restrictions, it&amp;rsquo;s safe to assume a similar setting will be added to iOS before the feature is released.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>AutoSpill the beans: not THAT big a deal</title><link>https://recyclebin.zip/posts/2023-12-21-autospill/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://recyclebin.zip/posts/2023-12-21-autospill/</guid><description>&lt;p>Research can be interesting, useful for risk management purposes, helpful to those building software and even entertaining.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sometimes, the usefulness of research is undone by the public discourse on a security issue.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the last few weeks, you’ve heard of “&lt;a href="https://i.blackhat.com/EU-23/Presentations/EU-23-Gangwal-AutoSpill-Zero-Effort-Credential-Stealing.pdf">AutoSpill&lt;/a>”, a vulnerability affecting multiple password managers on Android.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I’ve heard everything about this vulnerability on LinkedIn. The posts are often accompanied by a AI-Generated image of a crying Android baby and broken padlocks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Quotes ranged from calls to warn everyone about this important vulnerability to “you should never use password manager browser extensions” (paraphrased).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When we make these types of claims, as security professionals, we risk scaring people away from a tool that reduces the risk they are exposed to.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If a single person stopped using a password manager and reverted to a text file, to using the same password everywhere, to using an “algorithm” in their heads to generate “different” passwords, that person is now less secure due to the discourse of security professionals on social media.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-facts-about-the-vulnerability">The facts about the vulnerability&lt;/h2>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Autofill vulnerabilities aren&amp;rsquo;t new. Yes, they&amp;rsquo;re a risk, but the majority of autofill action happens on legitimate sites, preventing phishing. Drama much?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Most password managers ask before spilling the beans. Calm down, it’s not a complete free-for-all.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>AutoSpill needs a malicious app to work. It&amp;rsquo;s not a web-based 0day in the wild. Walled gardens like App Store or Play Store keep most nasties out.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Password managers are patching or have patched this. Fearmongers, please take a seat. By the time you switch to &lt;code>Password123$&lt;/code> or to your “elite brain generated algorithm”, it&amp;rsquo;ll be a non-issue.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>If many people in your family are on the Apple ecosystem, here are a few things worth checking while you’re going to be in the same physical location over the holidays.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ensure they have enough iCloud data and recent backups, then, enable automatic updates, and nudge them into updating (bring a couple chargers!), as these features are recent.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If they don’t have any iCloud storage, consider rolling them into your iCloud “Family” to share paid storage, it’s cheap and sometimes worth it versus trying to convince people to pay for backups 😅.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then, go into iCloud Settings/Security and review the following:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Enable iCloud &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/authentication/">Two-Factor Authentication&lt;/a> (2FA) if they don’t have it. No need to go crazy with FIDO keys unless they’re security nerds or at-risk targets.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Account Recovery: Make sure everyone has at least one “&lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212513">Recovery Contact&lt;/a>” to help them back into their Apple IDs if something happens.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Legacy Contact: Do the same for “&lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/102631">Legacy Contacts&lt;/a>”, which can be used to recover access to someone’s iCloud data after they pass. It’s less awkward to do this while reviewing a bunch of security settings than to bring it up on its own randomly!&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>As a bonus, if you’ve got security enthusiasts around you who have up to date devices on their Apple accounts, it’s a good time to enable &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213465">iMessage Contact Key Verification&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Most people don’t need it, but if they’re interested in security, it’s a nice feature to demo while in physical proximity.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Using HomeKit Devices Across VLANs and Subnets</title><link>https://recyclebin.zip/posts/medium-posts-homekit-vlans/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://recyclebin.zip/posts/medium-posts-homekit-vlans/</guid><description>&lt;p>This article was originally posted on &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@gepeto42/using-homekit-devices-across-vlans-and-subnets-aa5ae1024939">Medium&lt;/a>. As I am removing my Medium articles, this will be the archive for this content.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Originally written on September 8, 2017.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>TL;DR Version: Make sure your iOS devices can connect to the HomeKit Devices on port 80 and 443, and replicate mDNS from VLAN/Subnet to VLAN/Subnet with Avahi.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, you’ve setup multiple VLANs and SSIDs at home, you’re keeping all those Internet Connected toasters away from the LAN where your crown jewels sit.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Good! Except, woops, a ton of stuff is broken?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>HomeKit uses the &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/homekit-accessory-protocol/">HAP Protocol&lt;/a>, which actually uses peer-to-peer connectivity for really fast action when you try to perform actions. If your device is unable to reach the HomeKit device, it will, through iCloud, try to perform the HomeKit action through your AppleTV.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If your AppleTV is unable to reach the HomeKit device, the request will fail.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If your AppleTV is in the right subnet and DOES reach it, it will work, however, it will be slower than if it had worked directly from your device. And believe me, 500ms of lag when trying to turn on the lights can be a significant pain.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here is how to get it working almost as if it was on the same network.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Note&lt;/strong>: This is not the most restrictive configuration possible. I am sure you can lock it down more, especially if everything you have has known hostnames or assigned IPs that do not change.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Allow your main LAN to connect to port 80 and 443 on HomeKit devices. You can do this via IP to IP + port rules, or, if you do not mind your main network reaching the IoT network, simply allow 80 and 443 from Main to IoT LANs. You can make this more restrictive by only allowing the static or reserved IPs of devices you use with HomeKit. Be sure to include your AppleTV or iPad so your schedules work when you’re away.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Disable Guest Isolation on your IoT SSID while you pair the devices (the pairing process seems to require p2p connectivity for some devices, and in any case, some apps will force you to send Wi-Fi settings from your phone, preventing you from being on the main SSID while you do this).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Join your IoT SSID with your phone.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Add the device to HomeKit. I tested this with iDevices devices (Ferrari LaFerrari anyone?). Their process for adding devices is very brittle, and I had a lot of issues, and had to try again many times. I had to do that the first time I set them up on a single Wi-Fi and VLAN however.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Install &lt;a href="https://avahi.org/">Avahi&lt;/a> on your Firewall, or on any device that sees both the Main and the IoT VLAN. It can be made to work on many devices, but of course if you are using pfSense it is available as a &lt;a href="https://doc.pfsense.org/index.php/Avahi_package">package&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Enable Avahi, and make sure it is listening on your IoT and your Main interface (deny it everywhere else). This is where you could potentially lock this down more: create custom rules and settings so it only works from specific IoT devices. In my case, it wasn’t worth it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Reconnect your phone to your main SSID.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Turn the lights on and off and on and off and on and off. And on and off and on and off. &lt;strong>It works!&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Re-enable guest isolation on your IoT SSID&lt;/strong>. Do not forget this step, you don’t want your toaster to hack your fridge do you? &lt;em>Note: Some APs are very hardcore with their guest isolation, and will block traffic from/to any RFC1918 address. If enabling guest isolation breaks your previously working setup, look to see if you can create custom ACLs on your AP. If not, I would recommend creating an SSID only for HomeKit devices, and leaving guest isolation disabled. In some cases, you will need to whitelist your Main LAN from it completely, but this should be filtered by your firewall anyway. On some, such as Ubiquiti UniFi gear, you need to allow the guest isolated SSID to talk to 224.0.0.251 for mDNS.&lt;/em>&lt;/li>

&lt;p>This article was originally published on the &lt;a href="https://fleetdm.com/blog/scams-targeting-google-groups">Fleet blog&lt;/a>. Minor style changes were applied.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Fleet handbook contains detailed information on how we have configured Google Workspace &lt;a href="https://fleetdm.com/handbook/security#email-security">to block spam and phishing&lt;/a>. Gmail has some exciting email security features, such as flagging or blocking mail from people with the same name as employees or quarantining it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These features are great for protecting from business email compromise (BEC) and other types of social engineering attacks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With this configuration, many of the less targeted, basic attempts at BEC get filtered, which is why an attempt we received a few weeks ago caught our attention.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Google Groups mailing lists have much weaker protection, and the Gmail security settings could create a false sense of security.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="attack-goal">Attack goal&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The attacker(s) seemed interested in obtaining copies of unpaid invoices from Fleet to our customers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As this seems to have been attempted by a BEC group, we think they likely wanted to obtain unpaid invoices so they could trick our customers into paying an actual invoice into the wrong bank account.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Even people well trained against these types of scams could fall to it, especially if the actual invoice they receive is the one they expected all along!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To obtain these invoices, the attacker impersonated a salesperson. Salespeople requesting copies of invoices could make sense, as they are often paid commissions or bonuses on sales and might get in touch with clients to make sure invoices are well received.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how-it-got-through">How it got through&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>As we have employee impersonation protection enabled, we were surprised that such a simple malicious email made it through the Gmail filters.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The attacker sent the message to a &lt;em>group/mailing list&lt;/em>, not an individual. The email had a valid DKIM signature, as a real email account was used, with only the name spoofed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once Google Groups processes the email, it forwards it to internal and external recipients. Since Groups is the one sending the message, with a &lt;em>from&lt;/em> that is now in the domain used for Google Workspace, the DKIM signature is valid. Internal recipients receive it without additional filtering, as it is a trusted internal email. External recipients receive it with a very high chance of delivery as the message is authenticated correctly and comes from a domain they interact with regularly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>From a UI point of view, the recipient can easily mistake the message for a legitimate one, as the domain name is either replaced with the legitimate domain or gets the mention &amp;ldquo;via legitimatedomain.com&amp;rdquo; added.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our mistake was assuming the message went through the same filters used for regular email. In reality, Google Groups uses different technologies for filtering spam, and the more advanced Gmail features do not apply.&lt;/p>

&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>We contacted Google to ask why this message made it through filters. They confirmed that the filters are different on Groups vs Gmail (emphasis ours) in a response to our issue:&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>We then asked if any of the advanced spam filter rules from Gmail worked in Google Groups:&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->
&lt;p>In this case, the attacker didn&amp;rsquo;t spoof our domain, so enabling this feature did not help.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Two weeks after this happened, we saw a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Centurion/status/1549780307544379392?s=20&amp;t=aehcFzyPfH_56fCLGpRddA">Tweet&lt;/a> by Chris Long at Material security, who had written a &lt;a href="https://material.security/blog/identify-google-groups-vulnerable-to-spam-and-spoofing">blog post&lt;/a> on this topic.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Chris and Material tested and realized that Google Groups delivered five out of six types of spoofed emails while Gmail blocked all six. They also figured out why the original email was replaced with the mailing list email, as Google Groups replaced it when the DMARC policy caused the delivery to fail.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We performed the same tests at Fleet, using &lt;a href="https://emailspooftest.com/">emailspooftest&lt;/a>. Our results were slightly different, but we successfully sent two very suspicious email messages to a mailing list. When we sent the same type of email to an individual, Gmail blocked each attempt.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how-we-noticed-and-stopped-the-attack">How we noticed and stopped the attack&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>At Fleet, we have excellent employees and contractors with amazing eyes for detail. We share information about potential scams, including phishing messages, over Slack, so the entire company is always aware of the suspicious stuff we see.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The person who received the email found it, if not necessarily suspicious, at least out of the ordinary. They contacted someone else to ask if that type of request was normal. This second person confirmed that it was not a genuine request and that, in any case, unpaid invoices should never be shared like this, even if the request came from an actual employee.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We communicate internally almost exclusively using Slack. Unlike email, impersonating someone on Slack would require compromising accounts configured with Two-Factor Authentication, making it a much more appropriate channel to discuss anything sensitive.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="recommendations">Recommendations&lt;/h2>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Warn and train all employees to be even more careful with mail sent to a mailing list, specifically that if an email is sent &amp;ldquo;via&amp;rdquo; your domain, it has a high probability of being spoofed.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Use a tool like &lt;a href="https://emailspooftest.com/">emailspooftest&lt;/a> as recommended by Material Security to test your filters. Try a regular user, then a group. Adjust your assumptions.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Limit the number of Google Groups that can receive external emails.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Limit the number of internal users that can send emails &amp;ldquo;on behalf&amp;rdquo; of a group, to prevent legitimate emails from being sent &amp;ldquo;via&amp;rdquo; the group and makeing people accustomed to seeing them.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Avoid using common/obvious names for mailing lists.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Apply Material Security&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="https://material.security/blog/identify-google-groups-vulnerable-to-spam-and-spoofing">recommendation&lt;/a> to flag unauthenticated emails to groups.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Train your accounting teams to never respond to such requests via email but to contact individuals through a safer way, such as Slack.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Train your accounting teams to share files using services such as Google Drive, with explicit sharing to other employees within the domain. That way, even if someone agrees to give our fake salesperson access to invoices, the person who will get access is the actual employee.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Special request&lt;/strong>: If you use Google Workspace with Groups for mailing lists, please perform the &lt;a href="https://emailspooftest.com/">emailspooftest&lt;/a> tests and open a support case with Google asking them to get Groups protection on par with Gmail. Without that happening, all the security we apply to individual accounts is moot unless you somehow have an entire company that does not need any mailing lists!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With the BEC cases explosion, we hope Google introduces more advanced spam filtering to Google Groups. We should not have to consider running email through a generic standard Gmail account and forwarding it from there instead of using Google Groups!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Securing bank accounts from business email compromise</title><link>https://recyclebin.zip/posts/2023-05-12-bank-security/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://recyclebin.zip/posts/2023-05-12-bank-security/</guid><description>&lt;p>This article was originally published on the &lt;a href="https://fleetdm.com/blog/securing-bank-accounts-from-business-email-compromise/">Fleet blog&lt;/a>. Minor style changes were applied.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="securing-bank-accounts-from-business-email-compromise">Securing bank accounts from business email compromise&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>According to the &lt;a href="https://www.ic3.gov/Media/Y2022/PSA220504">FBI&lt;/a>, business email compromise (BEC) attacks are increasing in popularity yearly, costing organizations over 43 billion dollars in losses between 2016 and 2021.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As BEC is a form of social engineering, we often think education is the only way to reduce the odds of getting compromised.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Security teams often focus on protecting IT assets only, but what could be more damaging to your company than having its bank account emptied fraudulently?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since BEC typically targets one straightforward thing, money, there are controls we can implement to reduce the risk significantly. The parameters suggested in this post are those we found the most useful through our research. Unlike previous posts in this series, we cannot be as specific about how to enable them as every bank is different.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="email-configuration">Email configuration&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>While good email hygiene can&amp;rsquo;t stop BEC, it can at least reduce the number of fraudulent emails that make it through and force criminals to work harder.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Require secure two-factor authentication (2FA) to access email, such as &lt;a href="https://fidoalliance.org/specs/u2f-specs-master/fido-u2f-overview.html">FIDO U2F&lt;/a> security keys. Using U2F keys makes the credentials phishing-resistant, lowering the risk of malicious access to your email accounts from being used to launch an internal BEC attempt.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Configure email security features such as &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/2466580?product_name=UnuFlow&amp;hl=en&amp;visit_id=637919491839685136-2075570827&amp;rd=1&amp;src=supportwidget0&amp;hl=en">SPF, DMARC, and DKIM&lt;/a>. These help make it harder to impersonate your domain name in an email.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Configure spam filters to protect your organization from people impersonating employees from other domain names. On Google Workspace/Gmail, this setting is called &lt;strong>Protect against spoofing of employee names&lt;/strong>, and you should enable it along with &lt;strong>Protect against inbound emails spoofing your domain&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>You can find detailed instructions on configuring Google Workspace in the &lt;a href="https://fleetdm.com/handbook/security#email-authentication">Fleet handbook&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="online-banking-configuration">Online banking configuration&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The best email configuration ever is not enough to protect from BEC and other types of social engineering attacks. Something will always slip by, and we must assume that even well-trained employees will fall for a good enough attempt.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you think you can&amp;rsquo;t fall victim to these emails, you probably have not received one that was sufficiently well-targeted and delivered at precisely the right time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As defenders, we often say that while we must always be perfect, attackers only need to succeed once. As &lt;a href="https://www.dragos.com/blog/industry-news/the-myth-of-the-adversary-advantage/">Joe Slowik&lt;/a> explained in this excellent blog post a couple of years ago, that is seldom true. We defenders have the high ground, but we often fail to leverage it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since we know the attackers are looking for money, instead of trying to train people to be perfect at spotting scams, which is impossible, let&amp;rsquo;s secure the cash!&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="authentication">Authentication&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>If someone can break into your bank accounts directly, they won&amp;rsquo;t need to come up with a convincing email or text message to convince you to move money. It is therefore critical to enable the most advanced security features your bank offers. Unfortunately, in North America, many banks fail to offer any 2FA or only offer SMS-based 2FA, which is the weakest form of 2FA but is still better than nothing.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol start="0">
&lt;li>Keep the number of people with online banking access as low as possible.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If available, enable 2FA. FIDO U2F, although very rare right now with banks, is preferable. Otherwise, use app-based 2FA. As a last resort, use SMS 2FA.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If a setting exists to make 2FA prompt either &lt;em>always&lt;/em> or &lt;em>when the risk level is high&lt;/em>, set it to &lt;em>always&lt;/em>. Weaker options leave the doors wide open for someone to bypass 2FA.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Some banks allow organizational-level controls, but most do not. You might have to talk to everyone with access to your online banking and check their 2FA configuration, but if you don&amp;rsquo;t have more than a handful, it&amp;rsquo;s worth doing.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="dual-control-for-configuration">Dual control for configuration&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Many settings we recommend configuring require high privilege access to online banking. We have to assume that a well-informed attacker would be able to trick someone into changing those.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By enabling dual control, one administrator can make a change, but it will not be active until a second one approves it. This makes it much harder for social engineering attacks to succeed and protects these settings if a single account is compromised.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="alerting">Alerting&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Alerts are often triggered when something bad has already happened, but sometimes, there might still be time to fix things before they worsen.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Depending on your bank, you might have various alerts you can configure. For example, &lt;a href="https://www.svb.com/private-bank/help/resources/digital-banking/managing-digital-banking-alerts">SVB&lt;/a> &lt;del>has&lt;/del> had security alerts as well as transaction alerts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If possible, enable at least the following:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Alert when a new recipient is added&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Alert when a wire transfer is created (domestic or international)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Alert when an external transfer is created&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Alert when an address or other contact information is changed&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Alert on any transaction above a certain threshold, such as $10,000&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Banks typically deliver these alerts via email, which is not ideal for rapid awareness. To improve that, create an email address never used anywhere else specifically for these alerts. You&amp;rsquo;ll then be able to integrate that mailbox to other tools, like Slack, by using a &lt;a href="https://slack.com/help/articles/206819278-Send-emails-to-Slack#:~:text=To%20send%20an%20email%20to,see%20your%20email%20in%20Slack.">forwarding address&lt;/a>.
With this configuration, you can deliver these alerts in your administrative or accounting channel, where everyone can see them, create a thread and ask questions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On top of email alerts, inform your accounting department that they should pay attention to push notifications from your online banking application. If you can keep the amount of &amp;ldquo;false positives&amp;rdquo; down and your accounting and finance are all in the same time zone, have a rotation for who will let the app notify them even when in do not disturb mode.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="dual-and-triple-approval">Dual and triple approval&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Most business banks allow customers to set thresholds above which the system will require multiple approvals.
A threshold of $10,000 before a second approval is needed makes sure that if an attacker compromised a single person, they could only send away money in $10,000 batches. Alerting remains essential as the total cost can grow pretty quickly, but it is much safer than allowing a single person to move millions of dollars.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Consider requiring three approvals for substantial transactions, as long as your team is large enough to accommodate this even when people are on vacation or unavailable for any other reason.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="ach-filters">ACH filters&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>ACH stands for Automated Clearing House, a network used for direct payments, especially in the US. If your company is in the US and deals with US vendors, you probably send most of your payments with ACH.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Many banks offer ACH filters on business accounts. These filters work like many security controls, using one of two main methods:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>In deny list mode, where you provide criteria to deny payments&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In allow list mode, where you give criteria to allow payments&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Allow listing is safer but requires more work to implement. Some banks allow combinations of vendors and amounts, while others only allow lists of vendors.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Before implementing ACH filters, obtain a list of all ACH transfers made in the last 18 months. Identify the vendors you have that are still active, the average amount you pay them, plus a buffer to cover increases, and then provide this list to your bank to enable ACH filtering in allow list mode. Have every other payment generate an &lt;strong>exception&lt;/strong> that will require manual intervention.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That way, it will be much harder for a single person to send a large amount of money to an unauthorized vendor, and accidentally sending large transfers to legit vendors will be blocked.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="training">Training&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>To protect against BEC, we will always need to train people. No matter what technical controls are in place, by using urgency and well-crafted pretexts, criminals will always find a way to trick people into acting against the company&amp;rsquo;s best interests.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you require advanced training before implementing these basic controls, you fail your employees by not providing a system and processes with essential protection. Security teams and organizations must design and configure systems where they are reasonably safe before putting the burden of security on the end-users. Of course, security is everyone&amp;rsquo;s responsibility, but how would you feel if your security team reminded you not to type your password on phishing websites before they had implemented 2FA for remote access?&lt;/p>
